[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) implementation in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

* Written in pure rust
* Generate rust code
* Has runtime library for generated code
  (Coded{Input|Output}Stream impl)

## About versions and branches

- `2.0.*` is the latest stable version
- `1.7.*` is previous stable version
- `1.6.*` was republished as `2.0.*` and no longer maintained. Should be compatible with `2.0.*`.
  If you are using `1.6.*` please update to `2.0.*`.
- `1.5.*` was republished as `1.7.*` and no longer maintained. Should be compatible with `1.7.*`.
  If you are using `1.5.*` please update to `1.7.*`.

`1.7+` `2.*` versions should follow semver conventions. However, if you are developing critical library
it's probably better to specify version as `~2.0` (`>= 2.0` and `<= 2.1`), but not as `2.0` (`>= 2.0` and `<= 3.0`).

Version `3.*` will **not** follow semver conventions, releases from master will be published as `3.*`.
`3.*` branch can be considered experimental.

Eventually some `3.*` version will be stable enough and will be re-released as `4.0`.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a list of changes and compatility issues between versions.

## How to generate rust code

There are several ways to generate rust code from `.proto` files

### Invoke protoc programmatically with protoc-rust crate (recommended)

Have a look at readme in [protoc-rust crate](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/tree/master/protoc-rust).

### Use pure rust protobuf parser and code generator (alpha)

Readme should be in
[protobuf-codegen-pure crate](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/tree/master/protobuf-codegen-pure).

### Use protoc-gen-rust plugin

Readme is [here](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/tree/master/protobuf-codegen).

## Generated code

Have a look at generated files, used internally in rust-protobuf:

* [descriptor.rs](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/blob/master/protobuf/src/descriptor.rs)
  for [descriptor.proto](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/blob/master/proto/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto)
  (that is part of Google protobuf)

## Rustdoc

docs.rs hosts [rustdoc for protobuf](https://docs.rs/protobuf/*/protobuf/).

## Copy-on-write

Rust-protobuf can be used with [bytes crate](https://github.com/carllerche/bytes).

To enable `Bytes` you need to:

1. Enable `with-bytes` feature in rust-protobuf:

```
[dependencies]
protobuf = { version = "~2.0", features = ["with-bytes"] }
```

2. Enable bytes option

with `Customize` when codegen is invoked programmatically:

```
protoc_rust::run(protoc_rust::Args {
    ...
    customize: Customize {
        carllerche_bytes_for_bytes: Some(true),
        carllerche_bytes_for_string: Some(true),
        ..Default::default()
    },
 });
 ```

or in `.proto` file:

```
import "rustproto.proto";

option (rustproto.carllerche_bytes_for_bytes_all) = true;
option (rustproto.carllerche_bytes_for_string_all) = true;
```

With these options enabled, fields of type `bytes` or `string` are
generated as `Bytes` or `Chars` respectively. When `CodedInputStream` is constructed
from `Bytes` object, fields of these types get subslices of original `Bytes` object,
instead of being allocated on heap.

## serde_derive support

Rust-protobuf can be used with [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).

To enable `serde` you need to:

1. Enable serde option

with `Customize` when codegen is invoked programmatically:

```
protoc_rust::run(protoc_rust::Args {
    ...
    customize: Customize {
        serde_derive: Some(true),
        ..Default::default()
    },
 });
 ```

or in `.proto` file:

```
import "rustproto.proto";

option (rustproto.serde_derive_all) = true;
```

You may now `Serialize` and `Deserialize` messages:

```rs
let my_message = MyMessage::new();
serde_json::to_string(&my_message).unwrap();
```
